# Personal Curriculum Vitae (CV) Website

## Project Overview
This self-started project aims to:
- Provide a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of my professional journey, including education, work experiences, technical skills, and projects.
- Offer a platform where recruiters, colleagues, and peers can explore my work and contact me directly.
- Enhance my visibility and accessibility in the job market, making it easier for potential employers to discover and evaluate my credentials and work ethos.
- Allow continuous updates and expansions, reflecting my professional growth in real time.
The main medium of display is Streamlit, while other libraries such as Pandas and Plotly help to display relevant information.

## Motivation
This project was started to create a professional online presence that accurately displays my skills, achievements, and experiences. In today's competitive job market, having a standout personal CV website can make a significant difference. This site serves as a dynamic and interactive resume and a platform to showcase my portfolio and projects in a manner that is not feasible on traditional resume formats.
